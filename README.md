## Overview

MedSim-AI simulates realistic clinical scenarios using Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning. Learners can:

- Conduct patient interviews in natural language  
- Receive AI-generated symptom profiles and histories  
- Submit diagnoses and receive structured feedback  
- Navigate interactive decision trees for differential diagnosis  

## Features

- **Virtual Patient Chat**  
  - LLM-powered responses with configurable patient profiles

- **Diagnostic Evaluator**  
  - Scoring on medical knowledge, communication, presentation  

- **Synthetic Symptom Generator**  
  - Randomized or disease-specific symptom sets  

- **Decision-Tree Module**  
  - Branching logic guided by user inputs 

- **Semantic Symptom Matching**  
  - Symptomâ€“disease similarity for prediction  

## How It Works

1. **Select Scenario**  
   - Choose from preset diseases or generate random profiles  
2. **Interview Patient**  
   - Ask questions and receive detailed responses  
3. **Submit Diagnosis**  
   - Enter differential or final diagnosis  
4. **Evaluate & Learn**  
   - View graded feedback and review decision paths
